[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saebyn/domesday.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/saebyn/domesday)


## Installation

You will need https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen to build domesday.

    $ git clone https://github.com/Saltbox/domesday.git
    $ cd domesday/
    $ lein uberjar


## Usage

    $ cd target/
    $ java -jar domesday-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar -A [2014-04-30T11:38:16-0700] -Z [2014-04-30T12:38:16-0700] -e [https://url.to.my.lrs.example.com/TCAPI/statements] -u [basicusername] -p [basicpassword] first_group_filename.txt second_group_filename.txt


Each filename passed on the command line will be treated as a new group to
tabulate on. Domesday will use the first line of each file as the name of the
group in the output. Domesday will use each subsequent line in each file as
an agent definition.
